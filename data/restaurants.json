    "description": "Servings and prices are great. The restaurant specializes in sea food. The parking is awesome. The service is really good. The view at this restaurant is amazing. There is always a table available, as the place is gigantic, like the servings. It is pretty quiet, all year round. The a-la-carte servings also come with an all you can eat salad buffet. Did I mention the servings sizes?"

It’s all very tasty. The service is above average comparing to other location in the same area. The food can take a while to reach your table."
